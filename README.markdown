# SASS mixins
These are a collection of sass mixins I use often.

## Usage
These can be used with SASS or [compass css] [compass_core_website].  To use these mixins simply include them in your src/partials directory and include them in the .sass sheet you want to use them in.

    @import partials/_border_radius
    @import partials/_box_shadow
    @import partials/_navigation-dropdown-horizontal
    @import partials/_tansparency
